# isobaric-correlations
Exploring correlations in an isobaric labeling mass spectrometry-based proteomic data set.

Developed by Proteome Proteomicsson 101 with educational purposes.

The notebook was created in Jupyter Lab on Ubuntu 20.04 running Python 3.8. The workflow depends on third-party libraries that can be installed via pip:<br>
pip install scipy numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
  
 Proteomic data set has been reported in [the article by Hultqvist *et al*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0568-5). LC-MS files have been [deposited at PRIDE archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD005236), and the relative protein abundance table from the proteomic analysis can be found in this GitHub repository.
